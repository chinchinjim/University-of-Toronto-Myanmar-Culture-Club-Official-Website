This gallery features photos from Bryan Dickie's published photo book covering
Myanmar's ongoing civil war. The book focuses on civilians who joined together
to form an opposition army dubbed the 'People's Defence Force' who are actively
fighting an entrenched military regime that took control of the country in the
2021 February coup. The gallery is free attendance and will be available
starting Sept 22nd until the end of September. The opening night will feature a
talk by Bryan Dickie. This event was planned and sponsored by the Myanmar
Culture Club UofT, Tea Circle, and Hart House Talking Walls. MCC hosted an
artist talk featuring photojournalist Bryan Dickie on his new photo book
“People’s Defence Force” We learned about Myanmar as a country, its history and
its ongoing armed revolution. It was a moving and educational experience. Thank
you to everyone who attended! A big thank you to Tea Circle and Hart House
Talking Walls for sponsoring and helping us host an amazing event. 100% of
proceeds from book sales go directly to the PDF camps. You can find the link to
