                <p>On February 11, 2023, at the Innis College Townhall Theatre, we hosted a film by Documentary Producer Ko Pauk called Rays of Hope. Most of the general attendance was by members of the Burmese community and the event was hosted largely in partnership with the Myanmar Emergency Fund. Food, some fundraising activities, and some performances were also held there as well.</p>

                <p>We joined the UTSU's Multi-Cultural Food Bazaar at the Student Commons. Using funding from our community partners, we served free Burmese Ee Kyaw Kway (Fried Bread) and Lay Pay Ye (Milk Tea) while having individuals learn a little bit about the country and culture. There was a great turnout of people interested in Myanmar and of course in our free food.</p>
