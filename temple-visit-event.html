MCC hosted a visit to the Mahādhammika Myanmar Buddhist Temple. We learned about
the principles of Buddhism and mindfulness. We got a chance to practice our
mindfulness through a guided meditation by the monk. Finally, we had a delicious
Burmese lunch with desserts. Thank you to everyone who joined us yesterday. It
was fantastic seeing you all! A big thank you to Tony Scott for co-organizing
and to the Robert H.N. Ho Family Foundation for funding our visit.
